//   - The system stack (aka startup stack) is not heap allocated, so even
//     though it may be referenced it will not be scanned by default.
//
// Therefore, we only need to scan the system stack.
// It is relatively easy to scan the system stack while we're on it: we can
// simply read __stack_pointer and __global_base and scan the area in between.
// Unfortunately, it's hard to get the system stack pointer while we're on a
// goroutine stack. But when we're on a goroutine stack, the system stack is in
// the scheduler which means there shouldn't be anything on the system stack
// anyway.
// ...I hope this assumption holds, otherwise we will need to store the system
// stack in a global or something.
//
// The compiler also inserts code to store all globals in a chain via
// stackChainStart. Luckily we don't need to scan these, as these globals are
// stored on the goroutine stack and are therefore already getting scanned.
