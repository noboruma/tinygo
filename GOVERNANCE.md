TinyGo Team Members
===================

The team of humans who maintain TinyGo.

*   **Purpose**: To maintain the community, code, documentation, and tools for the TinyGo compiler.
*   **Board**: The group of people who share responsibility for key decisions for the TinyGo organization.  
    *   **Majority Voting**: The board makes decisions by majority vote.
    *   **Membership**: The board elects its own members.
*   **Do-ocracy**: Those who step forward to do a given task propose how it should be done. Then other interested people can make comments.
*   **Proof of Work**: Power in decision-making is slightly weighted based on a participant's labor for the community.
*   **Initiation**: We need to establish a procedure for how people join the team of maintainers.
*   **Transparency**: Important information should be made publicly available, ideally in a way that allows for public comment.
*   **Code of Conduct**: Participants agree to abide by the current project Code of Conduct.
